## Core Workflow Skills

### `/sdd-help`
Interactive in-chat guide and cheat sheet for all commands, options, and recipes.
- Explains syntax and flags (`--parallel`, `--regulatory`, `--json`).
- Recommends workflows for greenfield vs. brownfield codebases.

### `/sdd-getspecs`
Universal Brownfield Reverse-Engineering engine:
- Traverses AST and imports to deduce architecture without manual cataloging.
- Bootstraps `.sdd/steering/` (`product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`) and `.sdd/steering/roadmap.md`.
- Generates unapproved spec seeds (`brief.md`, `spec.json`, EARS stubs) requiring human review and approval.

### `/sdd-discovery`
Unified entry point for new features, requests, or initiatives:
- Determines decomposition strategy (single spec, multiple specs, or direct implementation).
- Writes `brief.md` and generates roadmap dependencies.

### `/sdd-impl`
Autonomous and parallel task implementation engine:
- **Parallel Wave Scheduling (`--parallel`)**: Dispatches subagents in concurrent waves where file boundaries are strictly disjoint ($\text{Boundary}(T_A) \cap \text{Boundary}(T_B) = \emptyset$), eliminating merge conflicts and race conditions.
- **Dynamic Role Dispatch**:
  - **Implementer**: Fresh context with Task Brief, executing TDD (RED → GREEN) under the Feature Flag Protocol.
  - **Reviewer (`sdd-review`)**: Independent evaluation of `git diff`, tests, and boundaries.
  - **Debugger (`sdd-debug`)**: Isolated root-cause analysis (max 2 rounds) on blockers.
- **`sdd-verify-completion`**: Fresh-evidence gate before marking any task complete (`[x]`).

### `/sdd-validate-impl`
Feature-level verification gate:
- Re-validates the full test suite and cross-task contracts.
- Discovers and runs autonomous invariant testing via **Agentic QE** (`agentic-qe.dev`, PACTS framework) when available.

### `/sdd-audit`
Continuous architectural compliance engine:
- Compares ambient code with `.sdd/specs/` to prevent architectural decay.
- Builds the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM).
- Audits compliance with **EU AI Act** (Art. 11 Technical Documentation, Art. 12 Record-Keeping, Art. 14 Human Oversight) and **NIST AI RMF**.

## Supporting Gate Skills

- **`sdd-review`**: Adversarial task-local code review verifying boundary scope, test validity, and spec fidelity.
- **`sdd-debug`**: Clean-context root-cause investigation triggered on failures to prevent context pollution loops.
- **`sdd-verify-completion`**: Verifies fresh execution evidence before any success claim is reported.
